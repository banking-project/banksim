# BankSim
BankSim is a banking agent-based simulation framework developed in Python 3+.

Its main goal is to provide an out-of-the-box simulation tool to study the impacts of a broad range of regulation policies over the banking system.

The basic model is based on the paper by Barroso, R. V. et al.,
*Interbank network and regulation policies: an analysis through agent-based simulations with adaptive learning*,
published in the Journal Of Network Theory In Finance, v. 2, n. 4, p. 53–86, 2016.
